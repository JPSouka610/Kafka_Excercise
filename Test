"Hi, I’m José, a data scientist with a strong foundation in data analysis and mathematics, recently graduated from ITESM. During my internship at Oracle, I worked on real-world projects that enhanced my skills in Python, SQL, and Azure. What sets me apart is my ability to transform complex datasets into actionable insights while learning cutting-edge technologies like Kafka and Power BI. I’m excited about leveraging my skills to drive data-driven decision-making in dynamic teams. Could we discuss how I can contribute to your organization’s goals?"
